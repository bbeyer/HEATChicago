Caracol,,Gathering Spaces,-87.608937,41.846187,86HJR9WR+FC,,,"Drawing on rich connections from the natural world and cultural symbolism, Caracol (“snail” and “shell” in Spanish) represents the immigrant´s desire to belong while maintaining the core of memory and identity. Snails perform a critical role in the food chain, breaking down plant matter and aiding in the nutrification of the soil. Likewise, immigrants economic and cultural contributions enrich and revitalize the host society. Caracol´s spiral-shaped structure suggests ongoing movement from the core to a widening exterior — from the familiar to the unknown. The installation includes a table that can function as a work or picnic table, and as a painting surface for a series of murals featuring the interplay of language and images, a stage, and a hopscotch game that uses Mesoamerican numbers.",Community Partner: Contratiempo (Pilsen) preserves and highlights the cultural identity and contributions of the Spanish-speaking Latino population in the United States.,"Lead artists / Artistas lideres: Georgina Valverde, Diana Solís, José Terrazas

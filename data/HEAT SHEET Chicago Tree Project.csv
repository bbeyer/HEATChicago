Conundrum,2017,Chicago Tree Project,-87.6462382,41.9641651,,"Bridges have many associations in the collective imagination – ideas about movement, progress, connection, and the human mark upon the landscape are often attached to bridges. They appear in literature and films, architecture and sculpture, mythology and painting. They link one thing to another, for better or worse, and a bridge seems like a poetic metaphor for the way the natural environment creates shared networks that ignore human borders. This bridge spells out two conditions: “right” and “wrong,” but it’s not clear which side is which. We would like our sculpture to visibly manifest the idea of a connection between human beings, and between humans and the environment.",The Chicago Park District strives to integrate art and nature in many ways to enhance the experience of public spaces; Chicago Sculpture International is a group of artists devoted to the understanding that sculpture is a unique and vital contribution to society.,Actual Size Artworks,https://www.actualsizeartworks.com/about,Gail Simpson and Aristotle Georgiades,Lincoln Park - Wilson and Lake Shore Drive,
The A'maze'ing Larvae of the Emerald Ash Borer,2017,Chicago Tree Project,-87.7023286,41.9208402,,"The dying ash tree is embellished with a maze carved into the trunk. The maze is solved by starting at the bottom of the tree and winding up toward the branches. By following the tracks one encounters several bronze larvae meandering up the tree. At the end of the tracks it becomes apparent that many bronze larvae are creating the maze and moving up into the bark. 

The design of the maze was inspired by the tracks of the Emerald Ash Borer larvae that bore between the wood and the bark of the tree blocking the capillaries from drawing nutrients and water from the ground to the leaves. Between one and three million ash trees in the city of Chicago will die from this infestation.","

The Chicago Tree Project was started in 2014 when the Chicago Park District was faced with the question of what to do with thousands of trees that had been infected with the Emerald Ash Borer, an invasive insect encouraged by climate change that has been destroying millions of trees in North America for the last ten years.  The Park District approached Chicago Sculpture International (CSI), and together they created a program that would give some of these sick and dying trees a second life as a work of vibrant public art.",,,Janet Austin,,

Readymade,2020,Chicago Tree Project,-87.7663985,41.9566286,," I have always remembered a convincing argument made by someone who had said that artists were like cats.  Here I was an artist making a sculpture in a dog park. Although I like trees, I often look at them and imagine what potential form lies beyond the surface. 

The dimensions of this tree were ideal for my project but this was a type of tree I had never encountered before.  As I carved back and forth through the growth rings of this Ohio Buckeye, I noticed an amazing amount of color.  Swirls of caramels, dark brown streaks and blue grey blotches made this the most colorful tree that I have ever worked with.

Natura Non Confundenda Est,2017,Chicago Tree Project,-87.6803988,41.8260837,,"Natura Non Confundenda Est translates from Vulgar Latin roughly as “Do Not Confuse Mother Nature.”  The modern meaning behind my sculpture when coupled with its title is rather intuitive.  Evidently the colloquial itself (as a way of life), passed down through ancient human intuition and inherent to being human, is long deceased.  When nature is confused or challenged, so too are its offsets, which are represented by all life of Earth.

Digitization of the physical world has rearranged and brought new defining purpose of being human.  An injustice to nature, this cataclysmic operation of repurposing mocks reality, transcends and eventually destroys what holds existence and life in breath. Redefining what it means to be human requires the dissolve of being through a process of self-immolation without having to physically set oneself aflame.  Within the engulfing pit of charred embers will nature continue to be questioned as relevant to being human.  Only after arteries and veins of Earth run dry and soils vamped to fissured cracks will the burning question between humans and nature be answered.",,Anthony Heinz May ,https://www.anthonyheinzmay.com,,"McKinley Park, north of soccer field",

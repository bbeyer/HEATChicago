Conundrum,2017,Chicago Tree Project,-87.6462382,41.9641651,,https://www.natureregen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Conundrum.jpg,,Gail Simpson and Aristotle Georgiades,"Bridges have many associations in the collective imagination – ideas about movement, progress, connection, and the human mark upon the landscape are often attached to bridges. They appear in literature and films, architecture and sculpture, mythology and painting. They link one thing to another, for better or worse, and a bridge seems like a poetic metaphor for the way the natural environment creates shared networks that ignore human borders. This bridge spells out two conditions: “right” and “wrong,” but it’s not clear which side is which. We would like our sculpture to visibly manifest the idea of a connection between human beings, and between humans and the environment.",The Chicago Park District strives to integrate art and nature in many ways to enhance the experience of public spaces; Chicago Sculpture International is a group of artists devoted to the understanding that sculpture is a unique and vital contribution to society.,https://www.actualsizeartworks.com/about,Gail Simpson and Aristotle Georgiades,Lincoln Park - Wilson and Lake Shore Drive,
The A'maze'ing Larvae of the Emerald Ash Borer,2017,Chicago Tree Project,-87.7023286,41.9208402,,https://www.natureregen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Emerald-Ash-Borer-Larvae.jpg,,Jane Austin,"At the end of the tracks it becomes apparent that many bronze larvae are creating the maze and moving up into the bark. 

The design of the maze was inspired by the tracks of the Emerald Ash Borer larvae that bore between the wood and the bark of the tree blocking the capillaries from drawing nutrients and water from the ground to the leaves. Between one and three million ash trees in the city of Chicago will die from this infestation.","

The Chicago Tree Project was started in 2014 when the Chicago Park District was faced with the question of what to do with thousands of trees that had been infected with the Emerald Ash Borer, an invasive insect encouraged by climate change that has been destroying millions of trees in North America for the last ten years.  The Park District approached Chicago Sculpture International (CSI), and together they created a program that would give some of these sick and dying trees a second life as a work of vibrant public art.",,Janet Austin,,

Here I was an artist making a sculpture in a dog park. Although I like trees, I often look at them and imagine what potential form lies beyond the surface. 

The dimensions of this tree were ideal for my project but this was a type of tree I had never encountered before.  As I carved back and forth through the growth rings of this Ohio Buckeye, I noticed an amazing amount of color.  Swirls of caramels, dark brown streaks and blue grey blotches made this the most colorful tree that I have ever worked with.

Natura Non Confundenda Est,2017,Chicago Tree Project,-87.6803988,41.8260837,,https://www.natureregen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Natura-Non-Confundenda-Est.jpg,,Anthony Heinz May ,"Natura Non Confundenda Est translates from Vulgar Latin roughly as “Do Not Confuse Mother Nature.”  The modern meaning behind my sculpture when coupled with its title is rather intuitive.  Evidently the colloquial itself (as a way of life), passed down through ancient human intuition and inherent to being human, is long deceased.  When nature is confused or challenged, so too are its offsets, which are represented by all life of Earth.

Digitization of the physical world has rearranged and brought new defining purpose of being human.  An injustice to nature, this cataclysmic operation of repurposing mocks reality, transcends and eventually destroys what holds existence and life in breath. Redefining what it means to be human requires the dissolve of being through a process of self-immolation without having to physically set oneself aflame.  Within the engulfing pit of charred embers will nature continue to be questioned as relevant to being human.  Only after arteries and veins of Earth run dry and soils vamped to fissured cracks will the burning question between humans and nature be answered.",,https://www.anthonyheinzmay.com,,"McKinley Park, north of soccer field",

I wanted to transform my tree into something that looked completely different from its original state, causing my audience to see the whole tree as a form of art rather than a tree. Movement and bold color as well as humor were important qualities sought while working on my tree. Because the natural form was very rigid and straight plus very wide, achieving these qualities proved to be a challenge.

With support from the Chicago Park District and Chicago Sculpture International, I transformed a tree killed by emerald ash bores with silver leaf.  Renewed, the tree now reflects its surroundings in the community. I worked on the tree over a period of about 6-weeks and fell in love with the quiet energy it emitted. I came to realize this tree will continue to provide a natural comfort for those able to hear the sounds of its roots.",,,,"Washington Park, near corner of E 60th and Cottage Grove",

These bands have been bent and shaped to create wave patterns to simulate the rubber bands in recoil. The wind will activate and bounce the stainless-steel bands, creating a kinetic sculpture that looks just like it had shot a rock into the air. At the base of the sculpture, Newton’s Three Laws of Motion will be reproduced. The Three Laws of Motion explain the science of a working slingshot and demonstrate the forces of nature that act on all slingshots. The intent of my slingshot sculpture is to engage the viewer to ponder art and physics. It informs this dying ash tree to live again with much purpose. In 2020, the steel sling broke and was replaced by a rubber one.",,,,Rutherford Sayre Park,
